## [10Print Pattern Challenge on p5 Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/vaqcoders/sketches/ry-NdnAo7)

---

## Instructions:
Here’s the challenge: go to this [link](https://editor.p5js.org/vaqcoders/sketches/ry-NdnAo7) and you’ll see some code already written. Press the play button to run the code. You will notice a pattern emerging on the right. The pattern draws itself from left to right because of the way that the code is written. My challenge to you is for you to edit the code so that the pattern is drawn from top to bottom and shifts over to the right when it hits the bottom. When you finish, save your code by signing in with your GitHub account and sending the link to Ethan so other people don’t steal your solution. The first person to pass the coding challenge will get VaqPoints! The top few people with the most VaqPoints will get a special Vaqcoders certificate at the end of the semester! If you have any questions or get stuck, ask Ethan or one of the amazing officers! Have fun!!
