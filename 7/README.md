## Instructions:
In the Droplet class, visit the render method and program a way to render each droplet. Necessary variables include: `this.x` and `this.y`, being the x and y coordinates of a specific droplet. Requirements: Make them purple and use a shape to render it (preferably [bezier](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/bezier)). Happy coding, Vaqcoders!
