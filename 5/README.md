## Instructions:
Here’s the challenge: go to this [link](https://editor.p5js.org/vaqcoders/sketches/ry-NdnAo7) and you’ll see some code already written. Press the play button to run the code. You need to program a way to turn all of this
```

into
```

```
If you are familiar with [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin), you should be able to tell what happened to the text. What you need to do, programmatically-wise, is take each word and translate it into its Pig Latin equivalent.

Pig Latin is a very simple language that uses very simple rules. All you need to know is that a word that begins with a consonant or consonant cluster shall have its beginning consonant or consonant cluster placed at the end with an additional `ay` added. So, `string` would become `ingstray`. As you can see, `str` was moved to the end and an `ay` was added beyond that. However, if a word begins with a vowel, just add `way` to the end of the word. So, `Ethan` would simply become `Ethanway`.

If you feel frustrated, take a break. If you need some hints, you can check out [my solution](/solution.js). If you are able to have the word `true` appear in your console, that means you have succeeded. If this occurs, make sure you are signed in on the p5 editor (try using your GitHub account), save your progress, and send a Vaqcoders officer the link to your solution. Ask questions, drink water, and have fun!
