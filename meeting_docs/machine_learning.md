# Machine Learning Meeting

## Tic-Tak-Toe
* machine learning experiment done with tic-tac-toe
* used beads in match boxes
* used a match box for each game state
* lets talk about which game states we'd use to simplify the process
* everytime it lost, they took out the bead that made them lose
* if they won, they were rewarded with a duplicate bead
* this is analogous to starting with randomized weights
* the weights are adjusted over time to create an accurate model
